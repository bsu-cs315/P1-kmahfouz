############### Project report

This iteration was the smoothest out of all the iterations. I think this is because I am getting more used to Godot and GDScript, as well as thinking like a game developer. I am also much closer to being caught up with all my classes which has made this iteration much smoother and less stressful. And no Git shenanigans. I think I followed the GDScript style guide well, hopefully I have not forgotten anything. I'm not neccessarily proud of this project, because I couldn't put in as much as effort as I would've wanted to, but it was still a great learning experience.
